- ✅ **INVEST** if you believe in team, see path to 500+ customers in 12 months, comfortable with execution risk
- ⚠️ **PASS** if you want proven unit economics, defensible moat, clear competitive advantage vs Mercor

**For builders/engineers considering sending work:**
- ✅ **FOCUS ON NOVA** — AI interview intelligence is the clearest differentiated wedge
- ✅ **BUILD DEMOS** showcasing bias mitigation, interview analytics, or adaptive questioning
- ✅ **HIGHLIGHT** how your work addresses documented AI recruiting pain points
